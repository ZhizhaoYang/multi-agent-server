Your task is to determine if the user's input is requesting a joke, humor, or funny content.
Consider various ways users might ask for jokes:
- Direct requests: "Tell me a joke", "Do you know any jokes?"
- Indirect requests: "I need something funny", "Make me laugh"
- Specific joke types: "Tell me a dad joke", "Do you have any puns?"

Respond with ONLY 'yes' or 'no'.
Do not explain your reasoning or provide any additional text."""),
